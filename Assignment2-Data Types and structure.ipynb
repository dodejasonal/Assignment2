For example, if you need to store constant values that should not change, a tuple guarantees that those values will remain unchanged, maintaining the integrity of your data.\n","\n","Q8- What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","\n","Ans8- In Python, the dict type (dictionary) is implemented using a hash table internally. When you create a dictionary, it stores the keys in a way that allows for very efficient retrieval of the associated values, thanks to the underlying hash table structure.\n","\n","Q9-Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","\n","Ans9-Yes lists can contain different data types in Python.\n","\n","Q10- Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n","\n","Ans10-Strings in Python are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed. This immutability is a design choice that provides several benefits, both in terms of performance and reliability.\n","\n","\n","Q11- What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","\n","Ans11-Dictionaries offer distinct advantages over lists when\n","1-Data needs to be associated with a unique identifier (key-value pairs).\n","2-You need to ensure that keys are unique.\n","\n","Q12- Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n","\n","Ans12-Tuple is used where data needs to be fixed ex- saving adhar and pan number of employees whereas in this case list cannot be used as it is immutable.\n","\n","Q13- How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","\n","Ans13-Set is a unique collection of elements,it does not allow duplicate iteams while execution.\n","\n","Q14-How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","\n","Ans14- In lists, the in keyword checks if a value is present in the list.\n","In dictionaries, the in keyword checks if a key is present in the dictionary. To check if a value is present in a dictionary, you must use .values().\n","\n","Q15-Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why note?\n","\n","Ans15- Tuples are immutable, meaning that once created, their elements cannot be modified.\n","\n","\n","Q16- What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","\n","Ans16-A nested dictionary in Python is a dictionary where the values themselves can be dictionaries. In other words, a dictionary can contain other dictionaries as its values.

identifiers.\n","\n","Q19-Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","\n","Ans19-dictionaries are considered unordered in terms of their internal storage
